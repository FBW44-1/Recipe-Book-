    <h1>Fluffy scrambled eggs</h1>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp whole milk or water</li>
        <li>Shredded or crumbled cheese optional</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your skillet on the stovetop and turn on the heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare your eggs. Break them into a bowl with a tablespoon of water or milk, some salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs briskly for 30-60 seconds, making sure the eggs are fully broken up and mixed well with the milk and the seasonings. Use a little elbow grease here, the more you whip it the better.</li>

        <li>Pour the eggs into the skillet. Keep the heat on medium/medium low, you don't want to rush it here-- if the skillet is too hot the eggs will cook too quickly and become rubbery. Once you pour the eggs in they will begin to cook immediately. Using a spatula (I use a wooden or silicone spatula so I won't damage my pan's nonstick coating), begin pulling the cooked outer edges in towards the center of the eggs. Uncooked eggs will flood the area you just pulled back. If you are adding cheese, now is the time to sprinkle it into the skillet. This will allow ample time for the cheese to melt and integrate into the eggs.</li>
        <li>Move the spatula around the edge of the skillet, pulling the cooked edges towards the center and re-flooding repeatedly. Cooked scrambled eggs will gather in the center of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat when the eggs are 90% cooked. When the eggs are done, serve immediately. Perfectly cooked scrambled eggs are moist but not runny, with no crisp or brown edges. This technique may take a bit of practice, but it is quite simple. With time you too will be making and serving moist, fluffy scrambled eggs!</li>
